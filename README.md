# BrewerySite_Backend
Web App that allow users to search for breweries in a given city. Backend is done using Python's FASTAPI with MongoDB alongside the OpenBreweryDB API (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).
Searches are done using the open source API and the save feature uses sends this data to a MongoDB database. This project was done for my personal use, but in the near
future I will add user authentication so that the site may go live.
